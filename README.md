# Wall Street Better

## Introduction

This is a web app created to track stock portfolios per user.

This was created over the week of March 2, 2020 - March 9, 2020

## Tech Stack

* React: Keeps UI and state in sync in a performant way through the diffing algorithm and the VDOM.
* Redux: Manages global state which will allow the app to scale if needed. Prevents the drill down Problem
* Found in React props managemet.
* Express: Web framework that allows us to create API end points, kept routes as RESTFULL as possible.
* Sequelize: Used to create datebase models and offers protection from SQL injections and allows developers to
* write code to query fast if the query is simple. Offers validation hooks as well.
* PostgreSQL: Free relational database with a lot of support. Requires PG drivers and PG HSTORE (Serialize/ deSerialize)
* SQL: Complex queries with many associations are easier to do in SQL in my opinion.
* IEX AI: Used to get data for our stock information.
